The below are brief outlines of my projects, which are primarily NLP-focused or university course projects.

## Natural Language Processing
- **Statistical Machine Translation** [[PPT]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-58IoGHbNI8Ji9Tqlyz_v6sYBe4C2gTJr_5YjeeAV4A/edit?usp=sharing)
    _Language Technologies Resouce Center, International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad_
    _June '22_
    This project was done and presented at [IASNLP'22](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/iasnlp2022/) - IIIT-H's Advanced Summer School on Natural Language Processing. 
    - Investigated the effects of tuning English to Hindi, Telugu, Tamil SMT models on different evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF, TER, etc).

The below projects were done as part of the Natural Language Processing team at [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), VNIT's AI & Robotics Lab. 
- **Open Information Extraction** (research work in-progress)
    _August '22 - Present_
    - Aimed at using improved embedding techniques to effectively perform the task of extracting structured triples from natural language sentences.
    - Working towards a publication to share results.

- **Sentiment Analysis & Text Classification** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/text_classification)
    _January 2022_
    - Aimed at classifying the polarity of a topic.
    - Read papers on different architectures for Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification.
    - Benchmarked the following landmark architectures in PyTorch on the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset.
        - LSTM - Test Accuracy: 87.62%
        - FastText - Test Accuracy: 86.28%
        - BERT - Test Accuracy: 91.44%

- **Neural Machine Translation** [[Github]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/neural_machine_translation)
    _December '21_
    - Read papers on novel architectures for translation among languages.
    - Implemented landmark architectures in PyTorch using the Multi30k Dataset for German-English.
        - [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - BLEU Score: 37.5 
        - [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) - BLEU Score: 31
        - [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) - BLEU Score: 20

- **Text Generation** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/char_rnns)
    _June '21_
    - Generated dinosaur names by building a character-level Language Model.
    - Compared the results of different sequence models such as Vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU, in PyTorch.

## Undergraduate Course Projects 
- A* Search Algorithm for the TSP (Artifical Intelligence)
- n-tile puzzle solver using bidirectional search (Artificial Intelligence)
- Heap Memory Manager (Concepts in Programming Languages)
- Linux shell (Operating Systems)
- Weather and Network sensor data management using AVL Binary search trees (Data Structures)

## Miscellaneous
