Hi! \
I am Fauzan Farooqui, a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur, India. \
I am a member of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), VNIT's AI & Robotics Lab, which is managed by undergraduate research-oriented students. At the lab, I am part of the Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning team, where we pursue research projects in the field. \
I am currently working on Open Information Extraction. I had been exploring machine translation (especially for low-resource languages) earlier.

In my free time (if I get any, that is), I like literature, catching up with the news, and learning languages. Learning about history and culture interests me too.

Please feel free to reach out to me for anything, be it open-ended discussions, feedback or colloborations!

PS: Please let me know if my profile could be well-suited for relevant Deep Learning opportunities you know about, or are hiring for! I am graduating in May 2023, and am **actively looking for research-oriented roles in Natural Language Processing/Deep Learning**, including pre-doctoral research assistantships. I am also interested in optimizing neural models (for example, on the compiler level) for efficient deployment. \
