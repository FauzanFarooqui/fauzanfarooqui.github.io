Hi! \
I am Fauzan Farooqui. \
I am a Research Scientist working on 5G Open RAN systems at the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT), India's telecom R&D organization. \
I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur, India. \
I was part of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), VNIT's AI & Robotics Lab, which is managed by undergraduate research-oriented students. At the lab, I pursued research work in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. \
I have worked on Open Information Extraction and Open Knowledge Graphs (you can check out my [publications](https://fauzanfarooqui.github.io/publications/)).

My [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lf_559g3T1dkEfL7x_yUlvXaxZk4blx8/view?usp=sharing) has my working experience.

In my free time (if I get any, that is), I explore literature, economics, catching up with the news, and learning languages. Learning about history and culture interests me too.

Please feel free to reach out to me for anything, be it open-ended discussions, feedback or collaborations!

<!-- PS: You can let me know if my profile is well-suited for relevant Deep Learning opportunities you know about, or are hiring for. (My interest is also picqued by systems (compilers, computer architecture) that support efficient AI deployment.) \ -->

Month | Status
---|---
**September 2024** | 75 contributors from across the globe, including me, collaborated on the [CVQA](https://cvqa-benchmark.org/) benchmark led by the diverse  [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) team. Happy to mention that this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967) has been accepted at the one-and-only NeurIPS (D&B) 2024! CVQA is a question-answering benchmark that stringently tests cultural understanding of multilingual multimodal LLMs.
**July 2024** | My current job role's title at C-DoT has been redesignated to Scientist (level B).
**May 2024** | We will be answering questions on our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.906/) on OIE, published at the LREC-COLING '24 main conference via the remote QnA session on May 22. Feel free to come have a chat with us and see our video presentation in the portal.
**February 2024** | Our long paper has been accepted to LREC-COLING '24! COLING is one of the Top 5 most prestigious international NLP conferences. This is quite special to us as it comes after months of deep work being recognized at a prestigious conference - with an undergrad-only team. Extending our work from our time at VNIT, me, Thanmay and Pulkit worked on leveraging linguistic structure to enhance open information extraction under the guidance of Prof. Mansi Radke.
**December 2023** | My colleague Thanmay will be orally presenting our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nllp-1.22/) in-person at the NLLP workshop on December 7. 
**October 2023** | Received our first paper acceptance! We benchmarked LLMs in the legal domain in a short paper at the NLLP'23 workshop, co-located at EMNLP 2023. Hope to see you in Singapore this year!
**August 2023** | Started my first position! I will be working as a Research Engineer on 5G systems at the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT, India's telecom R&D organization).
**December 2022** | Selected as a Student Volunteer at the prestigious on-site EMNLP 2022 conference at Abu Dhabi, UAE. I will be at the UM-IoS workshop in-person all day on December 7.
**July 2022** | Started my research internship on Open Information Extraction at VNIT, supervised by Prof. Mansi Radke.
**June 2022** | Selected to attend IASNLP'22 - International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad's Advanced Natural Language Processing Summer School.
