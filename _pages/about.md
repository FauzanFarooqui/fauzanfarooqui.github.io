Hi!
I am Fauzan Farooqui.
I am a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur, India. 
I am a member of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), VNIT's AI & Robotics Lab, which is managed by undergraduate research-oriented students. At the lab, I am part of the Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning team, where we pursue research projects in the field.
I am currently working on Open Information Extraction.

Personally, I like literature, catching up with the news, and learning languages. Getting to learn about history with culture and exploring diverse/artisitc experiences interest me too.
